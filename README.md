# Miscellaneous Python scripts and modules. 

Many of the Python files that will eventually be posted here are to contain practical functions for processing and analysis of flat files, vector and raster datasets. Due to NDA, a lot of my code cannot be openly shared. To be updated as time permits.

In the GIS/Remote Sensing arena, dependencies are either restricted (arcpy with an Esri product license) or open source (GDAL/OGR libraries). As I continue to add content to this repository, there will be a mixture of programs that utilize both restricted/open source libraries but with a focus on using open source libraries for wider distribution.   

Bye for now
