# Miscellaneous Python programs and scripts. 

Many of the Python files that will eventually be posted here are to contain practical functions for processing and analysis of tabular, vector and raster datasets. To be updated as time permits.

In the GIS/Remote Sensing arena, dependencies are primarily restricted (arcpy with an Esri product license) or open source (GDAL/OGR libraries). As I continue to add content to this repository, there will be a mix of scripts that use arcpy but with a transition to using open source libraries for wider distribution.   

Bye for now
